PEETCODE!
I have connected the frontend and backend i made here: https://github.com/oblionC/react-assignment and https://github.com/oblionC/full-stack-assignment to make a full fledged working website. 

To run, 
1) Install all the dependecies. The backend uses express and the frontend uses react.
2) Run nodemon index.js in the backend file.
3) Run npm run dev in the frontend file.
